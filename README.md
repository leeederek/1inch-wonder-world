# ðŸ§¯ 1Inch (wonder)World
A World App mini-app that connects the Real Human Network with one-stop access to decentralized finance - all through 1Inch. 

## What does it do?
The 1Inch (wonder)World mini-app can be thought of as a comprehensive and clean frontend interface for Real Humans to the world of decentralized finance - facilitated by 1Inch's robust suite of products and technologies. 

With the 1Inch (wonder)World app, real humans can perform the following workflows straight from within the World App (i.e. without leaving the Worldcoin Ecosystem):
- Track their portfolio balances across all their wallets and all major chains that 1Inch supports
- Initiate cross-chain swaps using 1Inch's MEV-resistant Fusion+ Relayer API for all the chains that 1Inch supports (specifically `
https://api.1inch.dev/fusion-plus/relayer/v1.0/submit`)
- See recent trading history across all the chains that 1Inch supports
- Visualize chart data for onchain assets, including ERC20 tokens, NFTs, and more using the 1inch Charts API
... and many more to come soon!
