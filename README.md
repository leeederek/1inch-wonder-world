# üßØ 1Inch (wonder)World
A World App mini-app that connects the Real Human Network with one-stop access to decentralized finance - all through 1Inch. 

## What does it do?
The 1Inch (wonder)World mini-app can be thought of as a comprehensive and clean frontend interface for Real Humans to the world of decentralized finance - facilitated by 1Inch's robust suite of products and technologies. 

With the 1Inch (wonder)World app, real humans can perform the following workflows straight from within the World App (i.e. without leaving the Worldcoin Ecosystem):
- Track their portfolio balances across all their wallets and all major chains that 1Inch supports
- Initiate cross-chain swaps using 1Inch's MEV-resistant Fusion+ Relayer API for all the chains that 1Inch supports (specifically `
https://api.1inch.dev/fusion-plus/relayer/v1.0/submit`)
- See recent trading history across all the chains that 1Inch supports
- Visualize chart data for onchain assets, including ERC20 tokens, NFTs, and more using the 1inch Charts API
... and many more to come soon!

## Who is this mini-app for?
Real humans who want streamlined, easy access to the world of DeFi straight from the World App - removing the need to alt+tab or use a different application to submit trades and track your portfolio.

## Why build a mini-app using 1Inch?
Our mini-app serves two sides of the market:
1. Providing current and future Real Humans on the World App with a clean frontend for accessing DeFi using 1Inch's battle-tested infrastructure and resolver network
2. Bringing order flow and volume to the network of Resolvers, contributing to a sustainable and strong DeFi market
